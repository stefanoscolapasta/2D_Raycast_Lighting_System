<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is and experimental project I'm working on to learn about Raycasting, Computer Graphics, OpenGl.
<br />
It's also my first ever program/code written in C++. I do anyway realize the monstruosities I have writtend and how bad the source code is.
<br />
A total refactor of the project will be vital and non-postponable.
